This will be my first time on stage, so I'm somewhat nervous.</q></p><p>The second daughter is Alicia, 16 years old, yet her manner of speech is still somewhat rough. <q>Surely it will be fine, my dear sister; you're quite diligent when it comes to teaching it, after all.</q></p><p>Finally, the youngest of the three, Lucia, who is but 13 years old. <q>Yet when I think the number of people in the audience, my, that alone makes me nervous!</q></p><p>Then appears the person around whom her thoughts revolve the most:</p><p class='center italic'>(dog barking)</p><p><q>Wait, Baron! You can't play on the lawn! It will be me who gets a scolding for it from the milord!</q></p><p><q>If we get expelled, you're gonna end up on the roadside, boy!</q></p><p>The gardener Eddie, and his son and assistant, the 14 years old Kurt Grohl. A vast gap lies between them and the social standing of Lucia… and yet, when the boy comes to her mind, the girl's heart keeps beating faster.</p><aside><p>Kurt's name comes from the members of the rock band <span class='italic'>Nirvana</span> (source: Japanese Wiki).</p></aside><p class='monologue'>Oh, this sensation, this feeling in my chest I can't tell anyone about!

Ah, my Kurt, why do you pain my heart so much? If my feelings ever reach 500, or even 1000, tell me, what shall I do then? Oh Kurt, why were you born as a gardener's son?

Bringing such a filthy hound into the gardens!</q> Alicia, as usual, gets irritated at everything, and it's always Maria who eventually calms her down.</p><p><q>Aren't you going too far, Alicia?

It's Kurt I'm interested in, actually.</q> Lucia then heads towards the cabin, where she runs into Eddie.</p><p><q>You took an awfully long road to get here, milady. What's more, all alone, if I see it right?</q></p><p><q>Yes, my sister fell ill… And you, Eddie?</q></p><p><q>Ah, the fever again, I see… As for me, I was about to check on Kurt, sleeping inside.</q></p><p><q>How is that Kurt still sleeping?</q></p><p><q>It's the boy's task to arrange the heather's clearing, and he does it at first light. He can get pretty tired by this hour.</q></p><p>Lucia was just about to head back to the castle, but her steps suddenly stopped, and she turned to Eddie:</p><p><q>Um, actually I'd gladly join for a cup of tea…</q></p><p>Eddie did raise his eyebrows, but still he invited the girl in. Inside, Kurt was sleeping on a couch. <q>If possible, Miss Lucia, please do not tell the milord that you're having a tea with his gardeners. Let this stay between us.</q></p><p>After that, Eddie returned to his tasks, leaving the two of them behind. Lucia sit there alone, deep in thought, resting her eyes on the tip of her shoe, with which she was poking the ground.</p><p><q>Ah, milady… To find you here… Let me clean up a bit…</q> waked up Kurt finally.</p><p><q>Don't worry about that, my dress will get dirty anyway after tonight's banquet. I'd rather stay here too, honestly…</q></p><p><q>Would you mind if I make some tea?</q></p><p>Lucia gave him a small nod; she felt like she is in a dream. Kurt then sit to the opposite end of the table, and an unsteady conversation began between the two.</p><p><q>So, what sort of things people discuss on such dinners in the castle?</q></p><p><q>Well I actually don't speak that much. My sister Alicia alone talks more than enough.</q></p><p><q>Is there a banquet, like, every night?</q></p><p><q>I'd have escaped by now if that were the case. They can be entertaining, but also very tiring. Even among all that people, you can be lonely.</q></p><p><q>What a strange world the nobles have… Ah, sorry! I didn't mean to say such things!</q></p><p><q>Hehe, it's fine. I will quit being a noble.</q></p><p><q>Quit?! Can you even <q>quit</q> something like that?</q></p><p>Lucia didn't know what to say, and made a sulky expression. She felt a sense of frustration.</p><p>She brought the cup to her lips, and raised her eyes to Kurt from behind it.</p><p><q>You see, I like the smell of the ground…</q></p><p><q>Milady, you… you have the sweet scent of flowers…</q></p><p>Saying that, he raised from the chair, put his hands on the table, and leaned close to the girl's face. He couldn't say a word more, and Lucia too went silent.</p><p>But the anxiety over their future outside the castle walls eventually erased the hope for a kiss.</p><p>Kurt sank back to his chair, and took hold of his teacup with both hands. A mixed feeling of love and anxiety welled up in their hearts, both of them feeling its weight on the other.</p><br><p class='center'>The thirteen years old Lucia<br>in body and soul still like a flower's bud,<br>her petals closed tightly…<br>And so this summer day too passes quickly.</p><a href="#night">(the day ends)</a><h3 id="alone1b-yes-lets-not-do-anything-rash">2 Yes, let's not do anything rash</h3><p><q>I almost forgot about my garden!</q></p><p class='center italic'>(birds chirping)</p><p>Lucia heads towards the small planter box, where she planted a few flowers. Yet even from afar she notices the various blooms in red and blue hues, growing vigorously. Then, as usual, she addresses the plants:</p><p><q>My little flowers, you all look so lively!</q></p><p>Then Eddie's voice roars from behind. <q>Look what you did, boy! Now explain it to the young lady! You being a seedling of a man is no excuse!</q></p><p>Lucia turns around, and notices Kurt, being pushed forward. Eddie then stands behind him with arms crossed.</p><p>To the puzzled Lucia, Kurt answers: <q>Um, you see, it was I who looked after the flowers, Miss Lucia. I've checked their ground, gave them water, I tried to take care everything…</q></p><a href="#alone1b-im-somewhat-disappointed">I'm somewhat disappointed</a><a href="#alone1b-kurt-took-care-of-them">Kurt took care of them!</a><a href="#alone1b-its-none-of-your-concern-eddie">It's none of your concern, Eddie!</a><h3 id="alone1b-im-somewhat-disappointed">2.1 I'm somewhat disappointed</h3><p><q>But why would you do that?

I thought it would delight you…</q></p><p><q>Thank you, Kurt…</q> she said in a low voice, but with mixed feelings still lingering on her mind. She felt as if her self-confidence, that she is able to do everything she wants, all that now crumbled down.</p><br><p class='center'>The thirteen years old Lucia<br>in body and soul still like a flower's bud,<br>her petals closed tightly…<br>And so this summer day too passes quickly.</p><a href="#night">(the day ends)</a><h3 id="alone1b-kurt-took-care-of-them">2.2 Kurt took care of them!</h3><p><q>Is that really true?!</q> Lucia jumped up with joy. But looking at Kurt's face, she once again had trouble coming up with the right words. <q>Thank you, Kurt! I'm so happy!</q></p><p>This made Kurt too a bit flustered. Eddie grabbed his ear, pulling him to the nearby bushes, and one could hear his voice of lecturing even from afar. Lucia meanwhile felt like she was dreaming.</p><br><p class='center'>The thirteen years old Lucia<br>in body and soul still like a flower's bud,<br>her petals closed tightly…<br>And so this summer day too passes quickly.</p><a href="#night">(the day ends)</a><h3 id="alone1b-its-none-of-your-concern-eddie">2.3 It's none of your concern, Eddie!</h3><p><q>It's none of your concern, Eddie!</q> Lucia was pushing Eddie's back with both hands, keeping him away from the small garden.</p><p><q>Ah, milady, I didn't do anything, no, it's the boy's fault alone…</q> But Lucia continued to push him, tears welling up in her eyes. Seeing that, Kurt apologized too:</p><p><q>I beg your forgiveness milady, it was my fault! If we have offended you, neither me nor my father has a stay in the castle any longer!</q></p><p>Lucia gave Eddie a last, big push. <q>I'm not angry, but leave me be now!</q> she shouted, tears starting to roll down on her face.</p><p>Seeing that, Eddie and Kurt once again were about to start a quarrel, but in the end Eddie left, and Kurt stepped closer to the girl. He then gently inquired about various things, while Lucia, covering her face with both hands, answered with but nods.</p><br><p class='center'>The thirteen years old Lucia<br>in body and soul still like a flower's bud,<br>her petals closed tightly…<br>And so this summer day too passes quickly.</p><a href="#night">(the day ends)</a><h2 id="alone2">Wandering alone (2)</h2><p class='noindent'>The usual courtyard — and like every day, the three sisters Maria, Alicia, and Lucia take a walk in its gardens.</p><p>…is how it usually goes, but instead of the usual trio, today it is only Lucia all alone. <q>Alicia is in bed with fever, with Maria watching over her.

Small birds chirp in a hurry, as if lamenting the short summer so common on the plateaus. The girl continues towards the grove of the white birches, passes the small pond there, the garden of medical herbs on its shore, eventually reaching the edge of the vast, primeval forest.</p><p>Wandering around, she somehow once again returns to the herb garden.</p><p><q>The young lady is from the castle, Baron, don't you go barking on her now!</q></p><p>However, the one following the dog was not Kurt this time.</p><p><q>A pleasure to meet you, sir.</q></p><p><q>The honor is all mine, milady.

I will scold you if you get so dirty!</q> But Baron doesn't particularly seem to care. <q>Oh Baron, you're so naughty! Could it be that your owner is so unruly as well? Oh, how I wish my Father to hold me tightly like this too, and let me leave the castle, dismiss me like any common maid!</q></p><p>Shouting all these loudly did made Lucia feel somewhat better.</p><br><p class='center'>The thirteen years old Lucia<br>in body and soul still like a flower's bud,<br>her petals closed tightly…<br>And so this summer day too passes quickly.</p><a href="#night">(the day ends)</a><h3 id="alone2-lets-take-a-rest">2 Let's take a rest</h3><p><q>There we go,</q> sits down Lucia just like that to the ground.</p><p><q>But milady, your dress will get dirty!</q></p><p><q>It's all right, don't worry about that, Ramons.</q> Lucia then called Baron into her arms. <q>I love you, Baron!
